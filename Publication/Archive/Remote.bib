ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:It is widely acknowledged that synonymous codons are used unevenly among genes in a genome. In organisms under translational selection, genes encoding highly expressed proteins are enriched with specific codons. This phenomenon, termed codon usage bias, is common to many organisms and has been recognized as influencing cellular fitness. This suggests that the global extent of codon usage bias of an organism might be associated with its phenotypic traits.RESULTS:To test this hypothesis we used a simple measure for assessing the extent of codon bias of an organism, and applied it to hundreds of sequenced prokaryotes. Our analysis revealed a large variability in this measure: there are organisms showing very high degrees of codon usage bias and organisms exhibiting almost no differential use of synonymous codons among different genes. Remarkably, we found that the extent of codon usage bias corresponds to the lifestyle of the organism. Especially, organisms able to live in a wide range of habitats exhibit high extents of codon usage bias, consistent with their need to adapt efficiently to different environments. Pathogenic prokaryotes also demonstrate higher extents of codon usage bias than non-pathogenic prokaryotes, in accord with the multiple environments that many pathogens occupy. Our results show that the previously observed correlation between growth rate and metabolic variability is attributed to their individual associations with codon usage bias.CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that the extent of codon usage bias of an organism plays a role in the adaptation of prokaryotes to their environments.},

@article{Taverna2002Why,
abstract = {There have been repeated observations that proteins are surprisingly robust to site mutations, enduring significant numbers of substitutions with little change in structure, stability, or function. These results are almost paradoxical in light of what is known about random heteropolymers and the sensitivity of their properties to seemingly trivial mutations. To address this discrepancy, the preservation of biological protein properties in the presence of mutation has been interpreted as indicating the independence of selective pressure on such properties. Such results also lead to the prediction that de novo protein design should be relatively easy, in contrast to what is observed. Here, we use a computational model with lattice proteins to demonstrate how this robustness can result from population dynamics during the evolutionary process. As a result, sequence plasticity may be a characteristic of evolutionarily derived proteins and not necessarily a property of designed proteins. This suggests that this robustness must be re-interpreted in evolutionary terms, and has consequences for our understanding of both in vivo and in vitro protein evolution.},
