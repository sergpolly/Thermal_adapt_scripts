% {\bf Figure S8. Synthesis costs negatively correlated with CAI} Proteins of each organism are divided into 5 quantiles according to their CAI rank and amino acid composition is averaged within each group, so that statistically averaged trend with expression level (CAI) can be conveniently analyzed. (A) archaeal and (B) bacterial trends are presented along with a random realization of the codon reshuffling procedure to emphasize statistical significance of the original trend. P-value is calculated using XXX number of random reshufflings. 

{\bf  Figure S9. $R_T$ subtle correlation with CAI} Proteins of each organism are divided into 5 quantiles according to their CAI rank and amino acid composition is averaged within each group, so that statistically averaged trend with expression level (CAI) can be conveniently analyzed. $R_T$ is a Pearson correlation coefficient between the average amino acid composition in each quantile and the thermophilic composition of amino acids, calculated used OGT>50C criteria. (A) archaeal and (B) bacterial trends are presented along with a random realization of the codon reshuffling procedure to emphasize statistical significance of the original trend (or lack of thereof). P-value is calculated using XXX number of random reshufflings. [CHECK ...]

% {\bf IVYWREL trends with CAI} Proteins of each organism are divided into 5 quantiles according to their CAI rank and amino acid composition is averaged within each group, so that statistically averaged trend with expression level (CAI) can be conveniently analyzed.
% IVYWREL metric is averaged for each quantile and (A) archaeal and (B) bacterial trends are presented along with a random realization of the codon reshuffling procedure. Original result can be expected by the random and can be explained using specificity of IVYWREL and the genetic code link. [CHECK ...]
