{\bf Figure S1. Dataset quality plots} (A) archaeal and (B) bacterial species used in our analysis are depicted on the GC , OGT plane to demonstrate uniform coverage and wide range of both values. Uniform coverage is preserved also considering organisms with translational optimization only (red dots)  Archaeal ``dip'' around 60C and bacterial peak around 37C are clearly visible. GC and OGT histograms are presented next to the corresponding axis.
