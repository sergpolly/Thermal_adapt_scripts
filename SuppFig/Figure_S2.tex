{\bf Figure S2. Palette of 20 amino acids frequency trends with temperature.} Proteome-wide average frequency of each amino acid is calculated for every organism and plotted against the OGT of corresponding organism {\bf(A)} for archaea, {\bf(B)} for bacteria. Each dot is color-coded by the genome-wide GC content of the genome. Amino acid combinations IVYWREL, DEKR(charged), LVI...(hydrophobic), G...(hydrophilic), and ILVM are presented on the bottom row. Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated for each box.  {\bf(C)} Shows how extreme halophiles stand out from observed archaeal adaptation trends.
