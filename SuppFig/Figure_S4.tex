{\bf Figure S4. Average CAI distributions compared for organisms with CUS (Codon Usage Selection) and organisms without CUS.}
Distributions of proteome-wide mean CAI for archaea with CUS (red) and non--CUS archaea (blue) {\bf(A)}, along with bacteria with CUS (red) and non--CUS bacteria (blue) {\bf(B)} are presented. Presented distributions confirm similarity between CUS criteria proposed by Botzman and Marglit and the one used in the present work.
