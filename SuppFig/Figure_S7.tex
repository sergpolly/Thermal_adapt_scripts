{\bf Figure S7. Simulated temperasture trends of the amino acid synthesis and maintenance costs fitted for archaea.}
Simulated average cost of amino acid (AA) synthesis and AA maintenance are presented for archaea in a wide range of trade off parameter $w$ {\bf (e,f)}, including the overall optimal one $w_{op}=0.05$ (trends with light brown square markers). Yellow-shaded area highlights optimal temperature span that is best correlated with the observed data. Observed archaeal trends are not reproduced by the simulatioed--optimal trends within the entire highlighted $T$-range. Highlited $T$-range overlaps with the area of meaningless $T$--values ($T$\textgreater1.3).
